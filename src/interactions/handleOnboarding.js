We're excited to have you join our community! To ensure this server remains a **safe space for university students**, we need to verify your student status.

**ðŸ“š What we need from you:**
- Proof of current university enrollment
- A few quick questions about your academic journey

**ðŸ”’ Your privacy matters:**
- This channel is private between you and our bot
- Your information is handled securely
- Only verified students gain full server access

Let's get started! ðŸš€`,
